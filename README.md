# My Neofetch configuration

You need <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/" target="_blank">Nerd Fonts</a> installed on your computer for the icons to work.
<br>You also need imagemagick and w3m if you wish to display an image instead of the ascii logo of your distro.
<br>Feel free to use this as a template to make your own neofetch configuration.
